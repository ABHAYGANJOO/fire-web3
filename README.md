# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# To install: npx hardhar
1. Helps to add blockchain backend. 
2. Additionally, it will generate a directory for contracts. This directory has files written in Solidity. This file contains the smart contract code that will interact with the blockchain.
3. It also creates directory called scripts, that will help us deploy the smart contracts to the Blockchain.
